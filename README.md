Welcome to the RAG Systems Projects repository! This repository houses a collection of projects and resources dedicated to the development, experimentation, and application of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. RAG systems combine the strengths of information retrieval and generative models to create more accurate and contextually relevant responses in various natural language processing (NLP) tasks.

# Repository Structure
1. docs/

    Documentation, guidelines, and detailed explanations of RAG systems and their components.
    Tutorials and walkthroughs for setting up and using RAG systems.
    Research papers and articles related to retrieval-augmented generation.

2. src/

    Source code for different RAG models and their implementations.
    Modular components for retrieval, generation, and integration.
    Scripts for training, fine-tuning, and evaluating RAG models.

3. data/

    Sample datasets for training and evaluating RAG systems.
    Preprocessing scripts for various types of input data.
    Instructions for downloading and preparing external datasets.

4. experiments/

    Experiment configurations and results.
    Benchmarking scripts and performance metrics.
    Notebooks for exploratory data analysis and model testing.

5. utils/

    Utility scripts for common tasks such as data cleaning, logging, and visualization.
    Helper functions for integrating with other libraries and frameworks.
    Tools for model deployment and serving.
